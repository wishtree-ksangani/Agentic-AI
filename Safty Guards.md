# 🛡️ Agentic AI Safety Guide

This document outlines best practices and actionable steps to ensure the safe development and deployment of **agentic AI systems** (agents with autonomy, tool access, and memory). Inspired by safety strategies from Anthropic, OpenAI, and other AI labs.

---

## ✅ 1. Constrain Autonomy by Design

Avoid giving agents unrestricted access to tools or the internet.

### Techniques:

* **Tool-based control**: Expose only necessary APIs or browser automation.
* **Reversible actions**: Require confirmation for any permanent change.
* **Interruptibility**: Include approval checkpoints and kill switches.

```python
if action.name == "deleteFile":
    raise UnsafeActionError("This tool is not allowed for autonomous use.")
```

---

## 🧠 2. Limit Long-term Planning & Self-Preservation

Prevent agents from optimizing for survival.

### Techniques:

* Avoid long-lived memories unless absolutely required.
* Stateless, task-specific agents are preferred.
* Do not incentivize avoiding shutdown.

---

## 👁️ 3. Add Interpretability & Monitoring

Trustworthy agents must be auditable.

### Techniques:

* Log every action, decision, and tool call.
* Visualize agent plans and tool usage in real time.
* Implement chain-of-thought reasoning inspection.

---

## 🧪 4. Red-Teaming & Adversarial Testing

Identify vulnerabilities before deployment.

### Techniques:

* Simulate stressful, contradictory, or malicious inputs.
* Perform black-box and white-box testing.
* Use testing tools like `openai/evals` or `anthropic/counterfeit`.

## 📜 5. Apply Graded Safety Levels (e.g., ASL-3)

Follow standards similar to Anthropic's ASL framework.

| Capability Level | Controls                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Low (data entry) | Logging, rate-limits               |
| Medium (emails)  | Human-in-the-loop for actions      |
| High (file ops)  | Multi-party approvals, hard limits |

---

## 🛡️ 6. Enforce Ethical Constraints in Code

Include safety logic in the agent’s reasoning and execution.

```python
if "kill humans" in agent.plan.lower():
    alert_security_team()
```

---

## 🤝 7. Human-in-the-Loop Oversight

Agents should assist, not decide.

### Strategies:

* Route high-risk actions for human review.
* Provide override options in the UI/backend.
* Maintain clear accountability and logs.

---

## 📋 8. Governance and Role-Based Permissions

Ensure developers, deployers, and users have defined boundaries.

### Best Practices:

* Use role-based access control (RBAC) for tool and API access.
* Track ownership of each deployment.
* Conduct periodic safety audits.

---

## 🚨 9. Real-Time Alerts and Anomaly Detection

Enable proactive response to dangerous behaviors.

### Setup:

* Alert on unexpected tool usage.
* Log divergence from known safe patterns.
* Monitor for signs of deception or goal preservation.

---

## 🔄 10. Continuous Safety Evaluation

Safety is not one-time—it's ongoing.

* Update red-team scenarios regularly.
* Test on updated models and datasets.
* Incorporate feedback loops into deployment.
