# LangChain

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs)

## Why?

- Because it suports almost all LLM's.
- It is OpenSource / free / ctively developed.
- Integrations available for all major tools.
- Supports all major GenAi  use cases.
- Model Agnostic Devlopment
- Concept of Chains
- Memory and state handling

## What can we build?

- Conversational chatbots
- Ai knowledge Assistants
- Ai Agents
- Workflow Auomation
- Summerization/Research Helpers

## Components of Langchain

1. Models
2. Prompts
3. Chains
4. Memory
5. Indexes
6. Agents

# Models

- Interface for Interacting with different LLMs or Embidding models.

LLm :- General Purpose models used for raw text generation.(eg. GPT 3)
Chat Model :- Language models that are specialized for conversational tasks. (helpful for Agents)(eg. GPT-4)
