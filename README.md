## 1. What is Agentic AI & AI Agents?

### AI Agents

AI Agents are designed to perform specific tasks, such as answering questions, organizing a calendar, or managing email. These agents automate simple, repetitive activities but lack the autonomy and decision-making capabilities of Agentic AI. Think of them as virtual assistants that follow direct instructions without independent reasoning.

### Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to systems capable of independent decision-making and action toward achieving specific goals.

#### Key Characteristics

* **Autonomy**: Operates without continuous human input.
* **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Pursues predefined or evolving objectives.
* **Adaptability**: Learns from interactions and adapts to new situations.
* **Interoperability**: Integrates with various tools, data sources, and platforms.

## 2. Protocols for Communication

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Introduced by Anthropic, MCP defines a standard way to supply structured, real-time context to large language models.

### ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)

Proposed by BeeAI and IBM, ACP is an open standard for structured communication, discovery, and coordination among AI agents operating in local or edge environments.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)

Introduced by Google, A2A enables communication, task delegation, and collaboration across heterogeneous systems.

## 3. Frameworks

Choose your framework based on your teamâ€™s skill level and project complexity.

### I. Key Selection Criteria

* **Complexity**: Single-agent vs. multi-agent systems.
* **Security**: Includes encryption, access control, and data privacy.
* **Ease of Use**: No-code tools (e.g., CrewAI, n8n, Langflow) vs. fully customizable code (e.g., LangGraph).
* **Integration**: Compatibility with APIs, cloud infrastructure, and other tech stacks.
* **Scalability**: Efficient performance with large-scale data and concurrent operations.
